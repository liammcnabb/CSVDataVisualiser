/**
\mainpage The mainpage documentation

This is the Doxygen documentation to be given with CS-235 Assignment 5,
The Documentation is used to give a description of classes and the methods that are found inside them.
This would help a new programmer understand our code more easily if they were to start updating the code from an older version.

\section data Data File Format
\subsection input Input File
For this program we decided to use <br>
<b> - .csv - Comma Separated Values text file format (ASCII)</b>

CSV files were used for a few reasons but the main reason is that it uses tabular data. Tabular data means that the data within

users have more freedom to use the program.

\subsection output Output File
The output we decided on was <br>
<b> - .png -Bitmap graphics (Portable Network Graphics) </b>

PNG was decided on because we believe it is one of the better image formats, PNG files are generally quite small, but still retain
 a good amount of pixels making the image clear, the other reason for this would be that we were limited to only two options by the specification given
